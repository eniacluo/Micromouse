***************************

To design a new algorithm for running a micromouse, you need to write your own strategy inheriting from class **Strategy** and overrides the functions:

    - *checkFinished()* 
    - *go()*.

Create a python file and write a function to create a micromouse to run.

Example
==========================
DFS algorithm for one mouse traversing the maze.
 
For a basic DFS algorithm for only one mouse running in the maze, you can write a Strategy called **StrategyDFS** which inherits the **Strategy** class and overrides the function *checkFinished()* and function *go()*. The function *checkFinished()* is called because the Task Loader repeatedly check whether the task applying the strategy has finished after calling function *go()*. The main structure of function *run()* of Task Loader is as follows:

::

    def run():
        while not strategy.checkFinished():
            strategy.go()

**Step 1**: Write your own strategy inheriting from class Strategy and overrides the function *checkFinished()* and function *go()*.

Letâ€™s suppose we write a class inherits from **Strategy** as follows: (copied from strategy.py -> **StrategyTestDFS**)

::

    class StrategyTestDFS(Strategy):
        mouse = None    # It is necessary to keep a mouse instance as a member variant of Strategy class
        isVisited = []  # The isVisited is a two-dimensional array marking which cell has been visited by itself or other robots
        path = []       # The path is a stack to track the path that mouse goes through
        isBack = False  # Use a flag to mark whether the mouse has gone back to the origin
        network = None  # The instance of NetworkInterface

        def __init__(self, mouse):  # Called when Micromouse add a task with this strategy and it passes instance of itself as the second argument
            self.mouse = mouse
            self.isVisited = [[0 for i in range(self.mouse.mazeMap.width)] for j in range(self.mouse.mazeMap.height)]
            self.isVisited[self.mouse.x][self.mouse.y] = 1  # 1 marks that isVisited[x][y] has been visited

        def checkFinished(self):
            return self.isBack      # The terminating condition is that isBack = 1

        def go(self):
            # Sequentially check four directions, go if there is no wall and has not been visited before
            if not self.mouse.canGoLeft() and not self.isVisited[self.mouse.x-1][self.mouse.y]:
                self.path.append([self.mouse.x, self.mouse.y])
                self.isVisited[self.mouse.x-1][self.mouse.y] = 1
                self.mouse.goLeft()
            elif not self.mouse.canGoUp() and not self.isVisited[self.mouse.x][self.mouse.y-1]:
                self.path.append([self.mouse.x, self.mouse.y])
                self.isVisited[self.mouse.x][self.mouse.y-1] = 1
                self.mouse.goUp()
            elif not self.mouse.canGoRight() and not self.isVisited[self.mouse.x+1][self.mouse.y]:
                self.path.append([self.mouse.x, self.mouse.y])
                self.isVisited[self.mouse.x+1][self.mouse.y] = 1
                self.mouse.goRight()
            elif not self.mouse.canGoDown() and not self.isVisited[self.mouse.x][self.mouse.y+1]:
                self.path.append([self.mouse.x, self.mouse.y])
                self.isVisited[self.mouse.x][self.mouse.y+1] = 1
                self.mouse.goDown()
            else:
            # When four directions are either wall or visited, go back one step by popping up path stack
                if len(self.path) != 0:
                    x, y = self.path.pop()
                    if x < self.mouse.x:
                        self.mouse.goLeft()
                    elif x > self.mouse.x:
                        self.mouse.goRight()
                    elif y < self.mouse.y:
                        self.mouse.goUp()
                    elif y > self.mouse.y:
                        self.mouse.goDown()
                else:
                # The stack being empty means that mouse has gone back to the origin 
                    self.isBack = True

            sleep(0.5) # Delay for better demonstration

Write a function to create a micromouse to run.

::

    from map import Map;
    from mouse import Micromouse;
    from strategy import StrategyTestDFS;

    def myMouse():
        mazeMap = Map(16, 16)                           # Specify the size of maze map: height and width.
        micromouse = Micromouse(mazeMap)                # Create a micromouse with the empty map
        micromouse.setInitPoint(0, 0)                   # Tell the micromouse the origin coordinate
        micromouse.addTask(StrategyTestDFS(micromouse)) # Use the created Strategy with this micromouse instance to add a Task
        micromouse.run()                                # The TaskLoader will run the tasks you have added

Customized Platforms
==========================
If you are going to demonstrate in CORE or EV3, you can directly utilize the **COREController** and **EV3MotorController**, **EV3SensorController** in *controller.py* and skip this step. The mentioned functions are atomic procedures for Task Layer to call so that when writting a strategy, you can just call *senseWalls()*, *goLeft()*, *goRight()*, *goUp()* or *goDown()* in **Micromouse** class without considering the direction it faces and writing code of manipulating the hardware.

If you have your own hardware platform or emulation software, write your own MotorController inheriting from class **MotorController** and **SensorController** for your hardware - robot. You need to override the functions in **MotorController**:

    - *turnLeft()*
    - *turnRight()*
    - *turnAround()*
    - *goStraight()* 

and functions in **SensorController**:

    - *senseLeft()*
    - *senseRight()*
    - *senseFront()*
    - *senseBack()*

Debugging in CORE emulator
==========================


Replace your Map
==========================
In *core_demo.py*, 
::

	mazeMap = Map(16, 16)

creates a new empty map with height=16 and width=16.
::

	mazeMap.readFromFile('/home/zhiwei/Micromouse/mazes/2012japan-ef.txt')

loads a map from a text file into micromouse's memory. You may replace the text file with your customized map. The folder *mazes* also includes a set of maps both in text format and a png file which is used for visualization in CORE.

  :height: 200


Communications Guide
==========================
The communications between micromouses are based on `Socket Programming <https://docs.python.org/2/howto/sockets.html>`_. The network module gives the high level APIs for micromouse to broadcast or receive packets. To use this module, you need to create an instance of NetworkInterface, and initiate the socket:

::

	from network import NetworkInterface
	self.network = NetworkInterface()
	self.network.initSocket()

If you need to enable the socket to receive data, you also need to start the receiving thread to prevent blocking the main thread.
::

	self.network.startReceiveThread()

If you need to send information in string, you can use ``network.sendStringData(your_data)``. For simplicity, you can use a dictionary which is the built-in data structure of Python. The framework will serialize the dictionary to a string to send. For example, usually the micromouses need to broadcast their current locations:

::

	myLocation = {'x': self.mouse.x, 'y': self.mouse.y}
	self.network.sendStringData(myLocation)

If you need to receive information from your neighboring micromouses, you can use ``network.retrieveData()``.
::
	
	receivedLocation = self.network.retrieveData()
	print((receivedLocation['x'], receivedLocation['y']))

The broadcasting packets are not only sent to the your neighboring micromouse, **but also sent to yourself**. To distinguish who sends the packet, you can put the unique entity, e.g., IP address of the micromouse, into the packet.

::

	myLocation = {'id': self.network.myIPAddr, x': self.mouse.x, 'y': self.mouse.y}
	self.network.sendStringData(myLocation)
	receivedLocation = self.network.retrieveData()
	if receivedLocation['id'] != self.network.myIPAddr:
	    print('This packet is not from myself!')

Demonstrations
==========================

*core_demo.py* is used for running the DFS in **CORE**. 

*demo.py* is used for running the DFS in **EV3**. 

Run in CORE
--------------------------

First make sure that CORE has been installed. If you have not installed CORE, follow https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPkPc2lbStwFtiukYfCxhcW7KewD028XzNfMd20uFFA/ to install.

Download the Micromouse framework from https://github.com/eniacluo/Micromouse. DO NOT only download the framework folder because the maze file examples are not included.

:: 

	$ cd /path/you/downloaded/Micromouse

**WARNING**: DO NOT make your path of Micromouse framework too long and sometimes it does not work if there are *special characters* like '_', '-', '/' in the full path. 

Configure the CORE environment for running *core_demo.py*
::

    $ sudo ./setCORE.sh

If you encounter any problems running the above script, you may need to manually_ configure_ the environment for CORE.

Open CORE to demonstrate:
::

    $ core-gui

Then open maze.xml, click the **Start session** button.

Visualize the exploring results:

Install python3-tk:
::

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-tk

Open the display.py before starting a session:
::

    $ python3 display.py

Use *Ctrl + C* to terminate.

Run in EV3
--------------------------
::

	$ nano controller.py

Uncomment this line: ``from ev3dev.ev3 import *``

::

	$ nano demo.py

Change the size to match your maze:
::

    mazeMap = Map(8, 8)

Specify the direction it faces at the beginning, *UP* is default:
::

    micromouse.setInitDirection("UP")

Set the initial coordinate x, y:
::

    micromouse.setInitPoint(0, 0)

Add the task with written **Strategy** instance:
::

    micromouse.addTask(StrategyTestMultiDFS(micromouse))

Download the framework folder into the EV3 robot.

Press the center button of EV3 to boot and wait until the main menu appears. Choose File *browser->demo.py*. Click the center button to start. The light may turn orange if everything is good. It is not necessarily that two mice start at exactly the same time.

.. _manually:
.. _configure:

Manually Configure CORE
--------------------------
Let the MDR node runs Micromouse automatically by adding a customized service.

::

	$ sudo nano /etc/core/core.conf

Uncomment the line of *custom_services_dir* and set:

::

	custom_services_dir = /path/you/downloaded/Micromouse
	listenaddr = 0.0.0.0

Save and Exit.

::

	$ cd /path/you/downloaded/Micromouse
	$ nano ./preload.py


Modify this line:
::

	_startup = ('/path/you/downloaded/Micromouse/backservice.sh',) 

Save and Exit.

::

	$ nano ./backservice.sh

Modify this line:
::

	export ServiceHOME=/path/you/downloaded/Micromouse/framework

Save and Exit.

::

	$ nano ~/.core/nodes.conf

Modify line 4: Add a **MyService**.

::

	{ mdr mdr.gif mdr.gif {zebra OSPFv3MDR vtysh IPForward MyService}  netns {built-in type for wireless routers} }

Save and Exit.

::

	$ chmod 755 __init__.py preload.py backservice.sh

**To check whether the Micromouse service has been added, restart core-daemon and open CORE:**

::

	$ sudo service core-daemon restart
	$ core-gui

Add a **MDR** node into the canvas and right-click the node, click *Serivce*. Now you can see *MyService* is appearing in the column of *Utility* and it has been enabled. Click the tool icon on the right of *MyService* and click the *Startup/shutdown* tab, you can see the complete path of *backservice.sh* is shown in the middle *Startup Commands* list. That marks the correct configurations of CORE.

::

	$ nano ./maze.xml

Change paths of 4 icons:
::

	name="icon" value="/path/you/downloaded/Micromouse/icons/robot***.png"

Change path of wallpaper:
::

	wallpaper {/path/you/downloaded/Micromouse/mazes/2012japan-ef.png}

Save and Exit.

::

	$ nano framework/core_demo.py

Change path of maze file:
::

	mazeMap.readFromFile('/path/you/downloaded/Micromouse/mazes/2012japan-ef.txt')

Open CORE to demonstrate:
::

	$ core-gui

Then open *maze.xml*, click the **Start session** button.
