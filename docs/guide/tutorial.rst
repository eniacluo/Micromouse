***************************

To make a new algorithm for running a micromouse, you need to do the following steps:
  1. Write your own strategy inheriting from class Strategy and overrides the functions:

    - *checkFinished()* 
    - *go()*.

  2. Write your own MotorController inheriting from class **MotorController** and **SensorController** for your hardware - robot. You need to overrides the functions in **MotorController**:

    - *turnLeft()*
    - *turnRight()*
    - *turnAround()*
    - *goStraight()* 

    and functions in **SensorController**:

    - *senseLeft()*
    - *senseRight()*
    - *senseFront()*
    - *senseBack()*

  3. Write a starting class or function to create a micromouse to run.

Example
==========================
DFS algorithm for one mouse traversing the maze.
 
For a basic DFS algorithm for only one mouse running in the maze, you can write a Strategy called **StrategyDFS** which inherits the **Strategy** class and overrides the function *checkFinished()* and function *go()*. The function *checkFinished()* is called because the Task Loader repeatedly check whether the task applying the strategy has finished after calling function *go()*. The main structure of function *run()* of Task Loader is as follows:

::

    def run():
        while not strategy.checkFinished():
            strategy.go()

**Step 1**: Write your own strategy inheriting from class Strategy and overrides the function *checkFinished()* and function *go()*.

Let’s suppose we write a class inherits from **Strategy** as follows: (copied from strategy.py -> **StrategyTestDFS**)

::

    class StrategyTestDFS(Strategy):
        mouse = None    # It is necessary to keep a mouse instance as a member variant of Strategy class
        isVisited = []  # The isVisited is a two-dimensional array marking which cell has been visited by itself or other robots
        path = []       # The path is a stack to track the path that mouse goes through
        isBack = False  # Use a flag to mark whether the mouse has gone back to the origin
        network = None  # The instance of NetworkInterface

        def __init__(self, mouse):  # Called when Micromouse add a task with this strategy and it passes instance of itself as the second argument
            self.mouse = mouse
            self.isVisited = [[0 for i in range(self.mouse.mazeMap.width)] for j in range(self.mouse.mazeMap.height)]
            self.isVisited[self.mouse.x][self.mouse.y] = 1  # 1 marks that isVisited[x][y] has been visited

        def checkFinished(self):
            return self.isBack      # The terminating condition is that isBack = 1

        def go(self):
            # Sequentially check four directions, go if there is no wall and has not been visited before
            if not self.mouse.canGoLeft() and not self.isVisited[self.mouse.x-1][self.mouse.y]:
                self.path.append([self.mouse.x, self.mouse.y])
                self.isVisited[self.mouse.x-1][self.mouse.y] = 1
                self.mouse.goLeft()
            elif not self.mouse.canGoUp() and not self.isVisited[self.mouse.x][self.mouse.y-1]:
                self.path.append([self.mouse.x, self.mouse.y])
                self.isVisited[self.mouse.x][self.mouse.y-1] = 1
                self.mouse.goUp()
            elif not self.mouse.canGoRight() and not self.isVisited[self.mouse.x+1][self.mouse.y]:
                self.path.append([self.mouse.x, self.mouse.y])
                self.isVisited[self.mouse.x+1][self.mouse.y] = 1
                self.mouse.goRight()
            elif not self.mouse.canGoDown() and not self.isVisited[self.mouse.x][self.mouse.y+1]:
                self.path.append([self.mouse.x, self.mouse.y])
                self.isVisited[self.mouse.x][self.mouse.y+1] = 1
                self.mouse.goDown()
            else:
            # When four directions are either wall or visited, go back one step by popping up path stack
                if len(self.path) != 0:
                    x, y = self.path.pop()
                    if x < self.mouse.x:
                        self.mouse.goLeft()
                    elif x > self.mouse.x:
                        self.mouse.goRight()
                    elif y < self.mouse.y:
                        self.mouse.goUp()
                    elif y > self.mouse.y:
                        self.mouse.goDown()
                else:
                # The stack being empty means that mouse has gone back to the origin 
                    self.isBack = True

            sleep(0.5) # Delay for better demonstration

**Step 2**: Write your own motor controller inheriting from class **MotorController** and **SensorController** for your hardware - robot. You need to overrides the functions: *turnLeft()*, *turnRight()*, *turnAround()*, *goStraight()* in Motor Controller and *senseLeft()*, *senseRight()*,  *senseFront()*, *senseBack()* from Sensor Controller.

If you are going to demonstrate in CORE or EV3, you can directly utilize the **COREController** and **EV3MotorController**, **EV3SensorController** in *controller.py* and skip this step. The mentioned functions are atomic procedures for Task Layer to call so that when writting a strategy, you can just call *senseWalls()*, *goLeft()*, *goRight()*, *goUp()* or *goDown()* in **Micromouse** class without considering the direction it faces and writing code of manipulating the hardware.

**Step 3**: Write a function to create a micromouse to run.

::

    from map import Map;
    from mouse import Micromouse;
    from strategy import StrategyTestDFS;

    def myMouse():
        mazeMap = Map(16, 16)                           # Specify the size of maze map: height and width.
        micromouse = Micromouse(mazeMap)                # Create a micromouse with the empty map
        micromouse.setInitPoint(0, 0)                   # Tell the micromouse the origin coordinate
        micromouse.addTask(StrategyTestDFS(micromouse)) # Use the created Strategy with this micromouse instance to add a Task
        micromouse.run()                                # The TaskLoader will run the tasks you have added

Demonstrations
==========================

Please read *core_demo.py* and *demo.py* to see how to use the framework. 

*core_demo.py* is used for running the DFS in **CORE**. 

*demo.py* is used for running the DFS in **EV3**. 

Run in CORE
--------------------------

First make sure that CORE has been installed. If you have not installed CORE, follow https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPkPc2lbStwFtiukYfCxhcW7KewD028XzNfMd20uFFA/ to install.

Download the Micromouse framework from https://github.com/eniacluo/Micromouse. DO NOT only download the framework folder because the maze file examples are not included.

:: 

	$ cd /path/you/downloaded/Micromouse

**WARNING**: DO NOT make your path of Micromouse framework too long and sometimes it does not work if there are *special characters* like '_', '-', '/' in the full path. 

Configure the CORE environment for running *core_demo.py*
::

    $ sudo ./setCORE.sh

If you encounter any problems running the above script, you may need to manually_ configure_ the environment for CORE.

Open CORE to demonstrate:
::

    $ core-gui

Then open maze.xml, click the **Start session** button.

Visualize the exploring results:

Install python3-tk:
::

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-tk

Open the display.py before starting a session:
::

    $ python3 display.py

Use *Ctrl + C* to terminate.

Run in EV3
--------------------------
::

	$ nano controller.py

Uncomment this line: ``from ev3dev.ev3 import *``

::

	$ nano demo.py

Change the size to match your maze:
::

    mazeMap = Map(8, 8)

Specify the direction it faces at the beginning, *UP* is default:
::

    micromouse.setInitDirection("UP")

Set the initial coordinate x, y:
::

    micromouse.setInitPoint(0, 0)

Add the task with written **Strategy** instance:
::

    micromouse.addTask(StrategyTestMultiDFS(micromouse))

Download the framework folder into the EV3 robot.

Press the center button of EV3 to boot and wait until the main menu appears. Choose File *browser->demo.py*. Click the center button to start. The light may turn orange if everything is good. It is not necessarily that two mice start at exactly the same time.

.. _manually:
.. _configure:

Manually Configure CORE
--------------------------
Let the MDR node runs Micromouse automatically by adding a customized service.

::

	$ sudo nano /etc/core/core.conf

Uncomment the line of *custom_services_dir* and set:

::

	custom_services_dir = /path/you/downloaded/Micromouse
	listenaddr = 0.0.0.0

Save and Exit.

::

	$ cd /path/you/downloaded/Micromouse
	$ nano ./preload.py


Modify this line:
::

	_startup = ('/path/you/downloaded/Micromouse/backservice.sh',) 

Save and Exit.

::

	$ nano ./backservice.sh

Modify this line:
::

	export ServiceHOME=/path/you/downloaded/Micromouse/framework

Save and Exit.

::

	$ nano ~/.core/nodes.conf

Modify line 4: Add a **MyService**.

::

	{ mdr mdr.gif mdr.gif {zebra OSPFv3MDR vtysh IPForward MyService}  netns {built-in type for wireless routers} }

Save and Exit.

::

	$ chmod 755 __init__.py preload.py backservice.sh

**To check whether the Micromouse service has been added, restart core-daemon and open CORE:**

::

	$ sudo service core-daemon restart
	$ core-gui

Add a **MDR** node into the canvas and right-click the node, click *Serivce*. Now you can see *MyService* is appearing in the column of *Utility* and it has been enabled. Click the tool icon on the right of *MyService* and click the *Startup/shutdown* tab, you can see the complete path of *backservice.sh* is shown in the middle *Startup Commands* list. That marks the correct configurations of CORE.

::

	$ nano ./maze.xml

Change paths of 4 icons:
::

	name="icon" value="/path/you/downloaded/Micromouse/icons/robot***.png"

Change path of wallpaper:
::

	wallpaper {/path/you/downloaded/Micromouse/mazes/2012japan-ef.png}

Save and Exit.

::

	$ nano framework/core_demo.py

Change path of maze file:
::

	mazeMap.readFromFile('/path/you/downloaded/Micromouse/mazes/2012japan-ef.txt')

Open CORE to demonstrate:
::

	$ core-gui

Then open *maze.xml*, click the **Start session** button.
